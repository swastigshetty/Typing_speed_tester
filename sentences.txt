War does not bring anything good to the common people.
If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door.
I am he as you are he as you are me and we are you.  
Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't after you.
You can, you should, and if you are brave enough to start, you will.
Your strength is just an accident arising from the weakness of others.  
They can only see the mere show, and never can tell what it really means.
